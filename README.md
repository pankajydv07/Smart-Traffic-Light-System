# Smart Traffic Light Control System ðŸš¦  

This project is a **Smart Traffic Light Control System** designed to dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic conditions, enhancing road efficiency and reducing congestion.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Timing Adjustments**: Traffic light intervals adapt based on traffic density.  
- **Backend Logic**: Developed using **C++** for processing traffic data efficiently.  
- **API Integration**: Powered by a **Flask API** for communication between the backend and front-end interface.  
- **User Interface**: Designed with **HTML** for a clean and intuitive visualization.  

## Technologies Used  
- **C++**: Core logic for processing and control.  
- **Flask**: API framework for seamless backend-to-frontend communication.  
- **HTML**: Front-end interface for user interaction.  

## How It Works  
1. **Traffic Detection**: Simulated traffic data or real inputs are processed.  
2. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The C++ program calculates optimal timing based on traffic density.  
3. **API Communication**: Flask API updates the front-end interface with real-time adjustments.  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-traffic-light-system.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd smart-traffic-light-system  
   ```  
3. Set up the environment and install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install flask  
   ```  
4. Run the Flask API server:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  
5. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the interface.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Integration with real-world traffic data through IoT devices.  
- Implementation of machine learning for predictive traffic control.  
- Enhanced UI for better user interaction and visualization.
